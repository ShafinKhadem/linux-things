In the online, you have to recursively search all pdf files in a directory and its subdirectories. An integer command line argument will be provided to your script. You have to find all pdfs with page numbers higher than that and copy those into a new directory. You also have to rename the pdfs in the order of their file sizes. That is, the pdf that has the smallest file size (with at least a certain number of pages) will be renamed to 1.pdf.
