// In ubuntu 16, don't try to install gcc above version 5, the latest stable I experienced was 5.4. Couldn't install 18 directly (installation kept stuck), but could upgrade from 16, which I think is better as it contains good old unity too. But for system settings like power, touchpad you often need to login to gnome and change settings and then log out and log back in to unity.

// In ubuntu 18 with unity, super+f4, super+space couldn't be used as shortcut.

sudo apt-get install dconf-tools

// now gui of gsettings is dconf-editor

to enable hibernation:

First run sudo systemctl hibernate and see whether windows remain open after restart.
If not: run grep swap /etc/fstab, copy the UUID, sudo nano /etc/default/grub -> after quiet splash, add: resume=UUID=(paste the UUID), sudo update-grub.

sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla
Copy the lines below and paste them into the nano window.

[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
ResultActive=yes

[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate;org.freedesktop.login1.handle-hibernate-key;org.freedesktop.login1;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-ignore-inhibit
ResultActive=yes

Save by pressing Ctrl-O then enter and then exit nano by pressing Ctrl-X.

Restart and hibernation is back!

Or run killall unity-panel-service to just reset the menu.

Some users will then need to run sudo update-grub to get the hibernate option to be available in the power menu. Some users may also have to at least log out then log in to get it to appear in the (upper right) power menu.


to enable hibenate directly using button (I think ubuntu 18's default interactive button is better):
Press alt+f2 and open dconf-editor (or in a terminal type dconf-editor)

Navigate to org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power and set your default button-power action there


//------to enable auto hibernate at low power
sudo gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-low 40
sudo gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-critical 30
sudo gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-action 25
sudo gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy false

sudo nano /etc/UPower/UPower.conf ==> replace these options' value:
UsePercentageForPolicy=true
PercentageLow=40
PercentageCritical=30
PercentageAction=25
CriticalPowerAction=HybridSleep



most wanted trick is ctrl-r, man, --help and using workspaces(enable by going to system settings>appearance>behaviour
command for changing the number of workspaces:
dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/vsize 3  (hsize=horizontal)
process to change the shortcut for switching workspaces:
Open the Keyboard utility.
In the Shortcuts tab, select Navigation and scroll to the bottom. Double click on a row and press your new shortcut keys.
//process to turn off workspace switching time:

//---------------ccsm / compizconfig-settings-manager seems to crash a lot with 18.04-------------

install ccsm: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
Open CompizConfig settings manager. Under Desktop → Desktop Wall → Viewport switching set Wall sliding duration to 0 and under effect, deselect all.

command for decreasing the brightness even more in ubuntu:
sudo su -c "echo 100 >/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness"
if u feel it to be too much dark you can simply increase the brightness by writing higher value instead of 100

to avoid repeating higher command u can simply use ctrl+r and then type some unique part of the command (it actually does reverse search), also up-down arrow can be used.

To run any application from terminal without holding it:
nohup balsalApplication &>/dev/null &disown

install alacarte, so that from 'main menu' app, you can create/edit menu item (hightail).

//------how to increase touchpad speed beyond max (max in system settings):
in terminal(of course:)):
xinput list
xinput list-props YOURTOUCHPADID

//-----change the cursor size:
install gnome-tweak-tool
gnome-tweak-tool(terminal enter, same process when an application can't be run normally)

sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
then run:

sudo apt-get update //it does only update the list of package, but doesn't install them
sudo apt-get upgrade

above three lines were the command to update system using terminal

how to automatically kill bluetooth and decrease brightness in ubuntu startup:
at first install nano
sudo -i
nano /etc/rc.local
add following lines after the #comments:
rfkill block bluetooth
sudo su -c "echo 100 >/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness"
sudo chown shafin /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
ctrl o enter and then ctrl x

//-------to update g++ gcc in ubuntu: g++5.5 is the latest version stable for 16.04-------

//-------to update java in ubuntu------
at first extract from tar.gz in home/shafin/Downloads/jdk....
then to update java:
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/home/shafin/Desktop/CSE/ubuntu desktop files/downloads/jdk1.8.0_152/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --config java

//------to update clang from already downloaded file-------
just extract the tar.xz file in usr/lib

//---------to create shortcuts---------
Either use ctrl+shift + drag and drop or: man ln.

to configure brightness directly you can change owner:
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /sys/class/ba.....
and then create a link to it in desktop
then you can also create a custom keyboard shortcut with command:
bash -c 'echo 150 >/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness'
or after creating desktop link:
gnome-terminal -- bash -c 'gedit ~/Desktop/brightness'
if you didn't change ownership change bash by sudo su

//---------installing deb---------
cd to that directory
then sudo apt install ./NAME_OF_THE_DEB
finding installation location:
dpkg-query  -S scenebuilder

to turn on auto mount open disks application, select the disk and turn off auto mount(it will actually apply auto mount at startup):)
to hide harddisk in ubuntu turn off auto mount and then turn off auto mount at startup and show in interface

//-----to speed up wifi--------
sudo gedit /etc/nsswitch.conf (thought it's better to use nano)
This will open the configuration file in gedit so that you could edit it easily in GUI. In here, look for the following line:

hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4
If you find this file, replace it with the following line:

hosts:          files dns

iwconfig to ensure that power management for wl... (note this number for future) is off:
