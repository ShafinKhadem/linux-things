opening a file using qt file chooser (e.g. from google-chrome) creates kdialogrc. Delete history from it i.e. delete the whole part with recent, don't keep the word `recent`.
rm -rf ~/.local/share/kactivitymanagerd/* ~/.local/share/RecentDocuments/*
chmod a-w ~/.local/share/kactivitymanagerd ~/.local/share/RecentDocuments ~/.config/kdialogrc
do a grep --include="*rc" -ir "recent" ~/.config -> konsolerc, systemsettingsrc, gwenviewrc in ~/.local/share -> krunnerstaterc, ~/.config/kdeglobals also contains `History Items`

How to select non contiguous files:
Hold the ctrl key and use the arrow keys to navigate to the files you want to select. You should see a border of tiny gray dashed line on the file which you have reached to. Then select it by pressing space. On pressing space the file is selected. Repeat until all required files are selected.

Konsole-> settings-> profile-> make a default profile and edit it -> appearance-> Linux-color (otherwise folders in hard drives look unreadable in ls), mouse-> { triple click selects-> from mouse position to end of line. miscallenous-> underline file (which will enable you to ctrl+click on files/folders from terminal results e.g. grep -n)
You can right click on konsole and open current location in file manager. Other very hidden konsole features include monitor for activity/silence/end_of_process:

```
#KDETip: Sync input to Konsole terminal panes:

1. Open terminal panes with [Ctrl] + [(], change focus using [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [left/right]. (also doable with multiple tabs).
2. Press [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [.]
3. Sync and share commands across panes
4. Stop sync with [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [/]
```

In file selector, change both location bar and file bar text completiion to 'dropdown list and automatic', right click to the right of location bar, change from edit to navigate.

Kubuntu comes with Muon package manager, so no need for another.

startup disk creator kept crashing, so I ran it with terminal, saw the error: module not found 'sip', solved by apt install python3-sip

ubiquity installer doesn't work properly with dark color-scheme. A temporary fix: edit /usr/share/ubiquity/qt/style.qss to replace

```
#setup_page,
#footer_frame {
    background-image: url(/usr/share/ubiquity/qt/images/main.png);
}
```

with

```
#setup_page,
#footer_frame {
    background-color: #777;
}
```

This will match both light and dark theme fairly well.

Execute .desktop files using kioclient5 exec <path-to-desktop-file>
kde bug 260266 has been solved by me in https://invent.kde.org/shafinkhadem/dolphin
As of 2021, kde has no keyring which is needed by vscode to function, so install gnome-keyring
kde login scripts are stored as .desktop files and for .desktop files to Exec a shell script, the script must start with a shebang.

display configuration has global scale which is extremely useful if your fonts are too small.
